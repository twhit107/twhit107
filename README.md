### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**twhit107/twhit107** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

-  Iâ€™m currently working on a markdown file for my semester long project.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to utilize the Unity Essentials and Creative Core pathways. 
-  Iâ€™m looking into using the gfraphics/visual effects, 3D Game Kit, and phyics features of Unity. 
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with in-depth game design features. I learned some basics last semester with Construct3. 
- ðŸ’¬I am not quite sure what typ of game I want to design due to my lack of experience. I have always been interested in attempting a horror game design.
- However, I am not sure what I am limited to with this project and I believe a horror game may likely be difficult due to their complexity. 
- I do not have a lot of experience with coding. So my goals for this project are to learn how to properly code my game design and figure out what type of game design will suit this project. I believe the animation systems, VFX, and audio features will be utilized in my game design. These are key components that are vastly utilized in most strategy based horror games.
